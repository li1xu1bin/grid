## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3B426B) to evoke a sense of depth and strategy, echoing the game's theme.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212529) for a sleek, modern feel that makes the content pop.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE72CE) to draw attention to key elements such as interactive buttons and highlighted stats.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to provide a modern, clean and easily readable text for both the team names and descriptions.
- Use minimalistic icons for the add team button and other interactive elements.
- Arrange team displays horizontally, similar to the image. Modal should appear centered on the screen with a slight backdrop blur.
- Subtle animations for adding and displaying teams. Fade-in effects are recommended for team members and data on display.
